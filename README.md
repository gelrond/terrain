<h2>Terrain LOD</h2>

I wrote this to try and create a terrain system that was easy to use and extend. I originally tried to use the ROAM algorythm but I had trouble getting this working 100% so I decided to do my own implementation that handles joining different LOD levels of terrain and neighbour LOD differences.
